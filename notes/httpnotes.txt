Your SPA angular app needs data. Data is obviously not in the code, so it makes a call to an external
web service or an API. It then ships it back as a response. 

Async - Callbacks, promises, observable.

We are talking about observables and reactive extensions.

Observables - Help manage async data. Treat these events as a collection, an array whose items arrive async
over time. Are a proposed feature for ES2016. Since we cant use that, we will be using reactive
extension (RxJS). Observables are used in Angular.

Observable Operators -- Methods on observables that compose new observables. Transform the source 
observable in some way. Process each value as it is emitted. Some examples are map, filter, take and merge.

Contrasting promises and observables
Promises - Provides a single future value. Not lazy, but NOT cancelable.
Observables - Emits multiple values over time, lazy, supports map/filter/reduce/other operators. CANCELABLE
